      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in anomaly containment was a lot easier than what people
          thought.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, though. It was. He thought so, at least. How many jobs gave&nbsp; you
          such clearly laid out instructions? Most jobs worth a damn, they paid you to sit down and pretend to work, or
          to work at an undefined &lsquo;something&rsquo;. You chip at nothing, or you have to come to some definition
          of what that is along with your co-workers, and then you all use that energy making sure that at least one
          thing gets done. Not like it matters. The people up top are rarely, if ever, losing money when you cock
          up.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not him, though. His days were simple. He woke up, rolled out of bed, ate,
          peed, found somewhere to shower, changed into his uniform, and then checked the todo pile. Camille, while kind
          of shy, did a bang-up job of keeping everyone focused on something, no matter what; for him, it was crunching
          numbers.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;And crunch them he did! Every day he&rsquo;d sit at his makeshift
          cubicle, papers in hand, and chop out stats for every single detail that might be important. Amount of limbs.
          Movement speed. Contact with other anomalies. Times turned east.&nbsp; The occasional cause of death. And
          there was nothing else he would rather be doing, really. There was something cathartic about trudging through
          all that raw data&nbsp; and coming out with only the essentials, like compressing coal into diamonds. Making
          things simple. Tidy. Put them in places where he could forget them, and then find them without even
          trying.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, at night, while everyone slept, he got to wander.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&rsquo;d wandered the Westerville Mall many times before-- everyone in the
          team had done so at least once. He preferred to meander through its windowless walls and ceramic pathways;
          he&rsquo;d count the shops with his fingers as he passed by, and note which ones moved out or in. The mall
          changed just enough to keep him entertained, but not so much as to throw him off guard. It was just
          right.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, the mall changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was once a quaint building morphed overnight into a sprawling mass of
          corridors and ramps and elevators and endless endless </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything
          </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">all leading to nowhere. Whatever may have been considered tasteful
          by human logic and reason was blocked off from the public: the glass halls they prided themselves on were
          locked off but not destroyed; the previous parking lot was deserted, leaving miles of pure darkness only
          accessible if you knew where to look; a lot of shops became minotaur-themed, for some reason, selling
          labyrinth-print shirts and mino-burgers.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mall had so many </span><em><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">things.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So many things that were
        </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">there</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the time. There
          were people and there were staff and they all had schedules and events and sales and they had so many
          variables to keep track of all the time. Walking at night, when no one else gave a damn, helped ease the
          monumental headache all that input gave him.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case in point: this part of the building was not something he&rsquo;d seen
          before.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville was sure he&rsquo;d tracked this whole section on his last walk: the
          amount of blocked-off sections, how many of those still had merchandise in them, how many still had shops
          that&nbsp; just refused to close. Devona could tell you from the top of her mind, easy-- she was cool like
          that. But not him. For him, that certainty was more an ache underneath his ribs:&nbsp; a message from the part
          of him that remembered where he&rsquo;d last been and where all the best hidey-holes were.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A grunt escaped him as he pushed over a maintenance door behind a large
          &lsquo;coming soon&rsquo; advertisement plastered where a stall should be. The iconic TV-ready smile of some
          famous actor buckled in on itself, the gap between their teeth and jaw giving in to show&hellip; yet another
          pathway.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How had he missed this one? Perhaps it was made more obvious by the ad than as
          the dull wall it was before. He&rsquo;d never know for sure; all there was left to do was to enter the
          man&rsquo;s maw.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First thing was the dust. There was so much dust. He pulled up the collar of
          his shirt to try and shield it from the barrage, the itch making him half-sneeze every third step or so. As
          the walk continued, the light pouring from the entrance became dimmer and dimmer, until he was basically
          standing in the dark. His eyes blinked, trying to make something out-- anything, really, that would make it
          worth it going further down this hole.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, fate sent a sign: a light from one of the stalls at the
          furthest end of the hallway, staying steady for a whole minute before rotating out of view. A flashlight? It
          had to be. Maybe there was someone still being sent to work in that hell-hole after all. Neville burst into a
          sprint, making sure to count the shops as he passed them-- abandoned food mart, home decor, home decor, bakery
          infested with rats-- until he made it to the source of that flash.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he found was something he wasn&rsquo;t sure he expected. Racks and racks
          of clothes-- pretty fancy ones, too-- some high-end shop tucked in the middle of goddamn nowhere. Were they
          expecting to make big bucks in this city? Well, judging from the state of clear disrepair, they didn&rsquo;t
          exactly win the lottery.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in the middle of all that, was Witherby.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He appeared to be surveying the place, the flashlight held up only by the tilt
          of his head against his shoulder, leaning over a glass case not too far from the register. The light bounced
          off the case and back onto him, showing his silhouette against the darkness.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a strange guy.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So this is where you hide, huh, Wibs?&rdquo; Neville heckled from his
          spot in the entryway, thumbs rocking back and forth inside his pockets as he stared off with a dumbfounded
          smile.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby froze, hands clenching at the sudden noise. A moment passed, then
          two-- his eyes closed in recognition, shoulders slumping back to where they were, and he continued on, as if
          Neville had never called him out in the first place. &ldquo;Impressive, is it not?&rdquo; he wondered aloud,
          talking to no one in particular. His eyes betrayed his ruse as they flickered between Neville and the case.
          &ldquo;Apparently they found it cheaper to leave all the merchandise here than to send a team to extract
          it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville let out a &lsquo;hah&rsquo;, walking closer to where Witherby stood. He
          turned to stand behind him, resting his head over his unoccupied shoulder. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t take you for a
          historian.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shrugged him off. &ldquo;Then you clearly do not know me.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville sat in that silence for longer than he should have, counting the
          seconds as they passed, as if that would make either of them talk any faster. It was of no use. Wibs was one
          of those people who could pretend you didn&rsquo;t exist&nbsp; for as long as he wanted-- perhaps it was just
          a skill that he picked up from the job. Either way, he&rsquo;d have to be the initiator. Just like at the
          water cooler, really! Like old times.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; he said, resting his weight over the case like one
          would at a bar, &ldquo;You come here often?&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;About as often as anyone else.
          Hadn&rsquo;t noticed this path even existed before they put up that poster. The printing made that door inside
          his mouth jut out-- it just&hellip; looked unnatural.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;d know all about holes in men&rsquo;s mouths,
          wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He let out an exhale, his hand pinching the bridge of his nose-- Neville
          cackled at his own joke all the while. Finally, Witherby opened his eyes again. &ldquo;We just let you speak
          all the time, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that, man! You&rsquo;re all out and about
          twenty-four seven!&rdquo; Neville threw his hands in the air. &ldquo;Who am I gonna tell all my material to,
          Ria?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, I feel your &lsquo;material&rsquo; may be too high-brow for
          her,&rdquo; he stated, flatly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you should give her more credit. She&rsquo;s
          trying.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
        </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can&rsquo;t
          give me that look just because you gave me a ball and I happened to swing it.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby let out a wry smile. &ldquo;So now we&rsquo;re talking about
          balls?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville&rsquo;s cheeks caught the slightest tint of flustering red, eyes wide
          as plates. &ldquo;Listen-- not fair!&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other man returned to the glass case as Neville coughed away the
          embarrassment --and the dust--, amusement never leaving the glint in his eye. At long last, Neville cleared
          his throat, his signature cool-guy smile coming back as if nothing had ever happened. &ldquo;All right! Okay.
          Listen. What&rsquo;s up with this? If you want help getting into that box, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For you to smash it open?&rdquo; Witherby spared him only a glance.
          &ldquo;No need.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached into his sleeve, pulling out two bobby pins; he tore the
          &lsquo;head&rsquo; off the first one with his teeth, then got down on one knee. Then, he bent the second bobby
          pin into the shape of a lever and rested the first one on top of it-- a makeshift lockpicking tool.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah.&rdquo; Nevile whistled, leaning forward. &ldquo;New party
          trick?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bobby pins pressed on the locks inside the case, pushing them up through
          trial and error; one by one they gave a soft click, until the case gave in with a &lsquo;pop&rsquo;.&nbsp;
          Peeking in, Neville could get a better view of the case&rsquo;s contents: six sets of jewelry-- two pairs of
          earrings, two necklaces, two watches--&nbsp; all neatly laid out for the best combination of storage and
          appeal. It was pretty to look at, for sure-- he could probably spend&nbsp; the rest of his natural life
          tracing out the inlays in some of them, but&hellip;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You, uh&hellip; got a girlfriend, or something?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby turned to him with a raised brow. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Or! Or a boyfriend! I don&rsquo;t actually know! I was just doing a
          bit!&rdquo; Neville&rsquo;s shoulders tensed up, his hands going up to his chest as if fending a tiger off.
          &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just never seen you around these kinds of places, man, and it&rsquo;s not like I knew a lot
          about you back when we worked, you know, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">there</span></em><span
          style="font-weight: 400;">, and you spend all of your time working, and I don&rsquo;t know where you go when
          you aren&rsquo;t working? I&rsquo;m just-- I&rsquo;m doing what Devy does. I&rsquo;m just asking. Are you just
          selling this off? Is that legal? I thought you were a tech guy, that's all.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silence in the room was nearly deafening in itself. Neville could feel
          Witherby&rsquo;s gaze as he looked at him; his black eyes, focused and unreadable, remained locked onto
          his&hellip; but what were they looking for? Ah, fuck, he cocked this one up. It&rsquo;s fine. This is probably
          fine, right? He&rsquo;d just wait for Witherby to dismiss him, and then he&rsquo;d leave, and it would be as
          if none of that conversation ever happened. He counted the seconds. He kept track of each moment he was still
          staring. Just so he&rsquo;d know.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven seconds.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby&rsquo;s eyes looked up, then left, as if recalling something-- and
          then he laughed. Not a chuckle, or a brief exhale. No, he </span><em><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">laughed,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting his hand up to his
          mouth to stifle the noise. With his other hand he caught the flashlight before it could fall off from its nook
          around his neck, leaving it pointed to the ground as he shook whatever he thought was so funny off of
          him.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, no, nothing like that!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never been good with
          computers. I&rsquo;m not seeing anyone, either.&rdquo; He reached for a pair of earrings in the display case--
          two silver studs in the shapes of crosses-- and nonchalantly pushed the edges of&nbsp; hair back as he put
          them on. &ldquo;These are for me. Although perhaps I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">could
          </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade these off. It&rsquo;s not like we get paid in fiat
          currency.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at his coworker&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Oh.
          I didn&rsquo;t know your ears were-- nevermind, that&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; stupid. What I was about to say!
          Not&hellip; not you.&rdquo; He cleared his throat. This was dumb. This was so, so dumb. How the hell did he
          manage to miss all that information? Did Devona ever catch it? He had so many questions. &ldquo;So&hellip; you
          like this stuff?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the luxuries of this world. Food is very&hellip;
          temporary.&rdquo; Witherby&rsquo;s hands had moved onto the necklaces; he rolled them out over his palm,
          bringing them closer to the light as he examined each one. &ldquo;I take it you don&rsquo;t change clothes
          very often.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, no. Kinda busy trying not to get murdered, and all that.&rdquo; He
          said,&nbsp; banging at his chestplate for emphasis. &ldquo;Especially with those weird ones that can walk
          through walls. Gotta stay safe, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I do not blame you, Neville. I was just making an
          observation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville merely watched as Witherby&rsquo;s eye remained trained onto the
          jewelry-- he put them back in the box as he went through them, as if discarding players for a draft.&nbsp; He
          saw him pause at the last one-- a golden chain--&nbsp; as he brought it up to the light, extending it in
          Neville&rsquo;s direction. Devona did that whenever she was trying to get a good shot-- what was he trying to
          do?</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Take off your tie.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wha-- huh? This?&rdquo; He replied, grabbing its edge from where it was
          tucked into his shirt.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He nodded. &ldquo;Just hand it over.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh. Yeah, sure. Here you go, man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville grabbed and pulled it out of place, the knot untying itself with the
          force, and leaving his hand holding it up like one would a fresh catch. As if on cue, Witherby stepped closer
          to him, necklace in hand;&nbsp; he put his hands around Neville&rsquo;s neck, wrapping the piece with a gentle
          touch, and letting it hang over his pristine white suit, while Witherby pocketed the tie.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, patting his shoulders with the tips of his
          fingers.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville blinked, brow furrowed, tilting his head down to try and see the chain.
          &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby let out a sigh. &ldquo;I figured you wouldn&rsquo;t.
          Here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that same grip on his shoulders, Neville felt a push as he appeared to
          want to lead him somewhere. Well, why not? He let the shove walk him through the shop, the lone flashlight
          serving as the guide, until they turned towards an area labeled the &lsquo;changing room&rsquo;.&nbsp; The
          light flashed back at them as it got reflected; he&rsquo;d been led to a mirror. Neville stood still as he
          took in the change, pacing in place as if to help him see everything better.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witherby leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms. &ldquo;The red is
          striking, but&hellip; gold suits you much better. It brings out your eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Woah. Hey. I guess it does.&rdquo; Neville reflexively gave his
          reflection a double thumbs-up, wide grin spreading across his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, shiny. Man, wish
          I&rsquo;d brought my glasses--&rdquo; he patted himself down-- &ldquo;That would&rsquo;ve been a good
          look.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Witherby stared off into the mirror, face as unreadable as
          ever. &ldquo;...perhaps we could find you a whole outfit in this section. I&rsquo;m sure if they kept jewelry,
          they must&rsquo;ve kept some new sunglasses.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neville&rsquo;s face practically
          beamed at the thought. &ldquo;Really? Dude-- that&rsquo;s cool! You&rsquo;re the best!&rdquo; He turned to
          face Witherby and tossed his arm over the man&rsquo;s shoulder, pulling him into a hug. &ldquo;Wait. This is a
          friend thing, right?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not trying to buy me out?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t work in my off-hours,&rdquo; he replied,
          matter-of-factly.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Okay, cool. Second question. Won&rsquo;t people notice if we walk out
          with anything?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;They don't have security here like we used to. I assure you they
          won&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that like&hellip; like a </span><em><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">crime</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&rdquo;</span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oh, Neville.&rdquo; He smiled back to him, that aura of deliberately
          manufactured mystery hanging in the air ever so slightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to learn a</span><em><span
            style="font-weight: 400;"> lot</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of things about me.&rdquo;</span>
      </p>
      <p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was weird. You work with a guy for so long, and you don&rsquo;t really get
          to know him. Not like where they worked on was known for fostering good on-site relationships,&nbsp; you know,
          with people dropping dead every day. But their little group was something different, They&rsquo;d all died, or
          close to died, back there, and yet here they were: alive and kicking, like it never happened. Maybe it&rsquo;d
          be a good idea to start getting the gang together. Get to know each other. And, if this universe wasn&rsquo;t
          against it, maybe even live a little.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, okay. I&rsquo;m ditching
          if we get caught, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Whatever you say,&rdquo; he answered, both of them walking back into the
          store.</span></p>
